        "RFM Segmentation technique is a very popular method of performing Customer Segmentation in Retail Domain.\n",
        "It is based on Behavioral Customer segmentation approach and focuses following 3 customer behaviour Metrics:\n",
        "1. **Recency(R)**: This the measurement of how recent the customers last purchase was.\n",
        "2. **Frequency(F)**: This measurement is for how many times the customer has purchased in the specific time period for which data was collected\n",
        "3. **Monetary(M)**: Measures the total amount the customer has spent during the data collection period.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Order to group our customers based on any business metric, we need to decide on number of groups as well as threshold or limits of business metric for each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to decide this. Given below are some of the popular ways to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Equal Percentiles: We can divide our customers into groups of Equal size i.e percentiles and assign them corresponding labels. For example, if we select 4 groups than each group will have 25% of total customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pareto 80:20 cut: Pareto Principle states that 80 percent of  outcomes come from 20 percent of inputs. This can extended to E-Commerce domain as well with assumption that 80% of revenue is generated by top 20 percentile of Customers. This 80:20 rule can also be used as a criteria to segment customers into two groups the top 20 or high value customers and remaining 80 i.e Low Value Customers\n",
        "\n",
        "- Custom-based on business knowledge: We can also use existing business knowledge or consult with Subject matter experts(SME's) to decide thresholds and number of segments to be created."
